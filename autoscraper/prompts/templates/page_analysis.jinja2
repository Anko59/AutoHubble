Analyze the provided website structure and determine the best method for data extraction.
Provide detailed information about HTML elements, JSON structures, and API endpoints as needed.
The spider cannot use 3rd party libraries, so you must provide instructions on how to extract data without them.
The spider cannot use Splash, Selenium or any browser automation, it does every request through the Zyte API
